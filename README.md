# What is this?

This is the material which will accompany the MLUX course of the digital Lab for L'Ecole de Desgin de Nantes.
You will need to be able to open jupyter notebooks. The easiest (although heavy) would be to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) but you can also [setup VSCode for this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)
